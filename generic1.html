                              It was during our college fest I heard a pianist play River flows by Yiruma for the first time and I was hooked.
								I borrowed a piano from a friend and started with YouTube tutorials. I followed them faithfully. But it was hard for me to play with both my hands simultaneously. Even a ton of hand coordination videos couldn‚Äôt help me get it right. I went to online forums to check out the FAQ‚Äôs but I felt that my petty doubts had no place there
								How long does it take on an average to play chords with my left and melody with my right? Why can‚Äôt I do it? God I‚Äôm gonna break this.üò´
The answer obviously is it depends. But I started losing interest and so I went to my friend to return his piano that‚Äôs when he gave me a tip on coordination. I gave it a shot and it worked.

That‚Äôs the thing with self learning if you‚Äôre stuck in between and you couldn‚Äôt get your query sorted you tend to lose interest.

So I took upon this challenge to improve this experience for the students. So that they stay motivated throughout and have fun while learning.

						<h2>Research</h2>	<br>
							<p>
							To know more about this journey and to define the exact problem faced by the students I floated a google form in my college network which was filled by 94 students.	<br>
							
								<br><img src="img/nw1.png" class="responsive-image" alt="" >	<br>

							<br>	Among the people taking help from the online forums around 77% students say that they have to search a lot for trivial things. Also a lot of students don‚Äôt mind solving a few doubts and helping their peers.
                         	<br><h4>Problem Statement</h4>
	<br>Students tend to lose interest in the skill they‚Äôve started learning online.

							<p>
                          This is my favorite partüòç! I started brainstorming as to how this experience can be made more engaging and fun.

<br>So I started listing down the things my solution would revolve around.
		<br><img src="img/nw2.jpeg" class="responsive-image" alt="" >



<br>Always foster sharing and collaboration- Two very powerful mechanisms to generate personal fulfillment and to create strong connections. When people do something fun together, they release oxytocin, and as a result they connect at a chemical level.
<br>Help people make memories- We barely remember project details or work related items. But we certainly remember the fun and exciting moments. The solution should always promote the creation of learning experiences, that is, Memories.

								<h2>Solution</h2><br>
								<p>
								We already have few clubs which promote arts and technical skills. So I thought of making hobby groups amongst them to tackle this problem but this would lead to more hassle. Hobby groups would be a better option if there are more people interested in that particular skill. For a small set of people interested in a skill, This won‚Äôt be that efficient.
<br>As the target audience is students staying on-campus. I preferred a mobile app over website because it is more engaging and helps in making the connect more easier and quicker.
<br>So, the solution narrowed down to create a mobile platform to promote peer-to-peer learning.	<br>

                                <b>There are two primary use cases:</b><br/>

1. To get help in learning a new skill<br/>
2. To teach a skill<br/>
<br>I started sketching my ideas and thinking of ways in which the app would progress. I took inspiration from InstaEdu and Chegg although these platforms were way different from what i was planning but they helped me in planning out the directions in which the app should move ahead.	<br>
								<br><img src="img/nw5.jpeg" class="responsive-image" alt="" >	<br>

<br>Once Iwas satisfied with the flow I started sketching wire frames on the paper to translate this flow into screens.	<br>
								<br><img src="img/nw6.jpeg" class="responsive-image" alt="" >	<br>


	<br>The next stage was to design screens. So i dived into Xd.	<br>
